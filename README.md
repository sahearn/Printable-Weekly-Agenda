Web based weekly calendar with print-friendly CSS layout

## Background
I currently maintain my family and personal calendars on Outlook. I pull those calendars down and use them in a few places like my private wiki, and I also wanted a weekly view of events that I could print out and share/display for my family.  This code/repo focuses primarily on the capability to format that display on the web as well as a print-friendly layout.

## What You'll Need
- PHP

## Screenshots

## My Approach
This is not the cleanest or most scalable solution, but the quick and dirty suits my personal needs. By default, the page loads displaying the current week and provides a dropdown to select weeks within the previous and next 15 days from "today".  There are also checkboxes to toggle the display of specific calendars.
